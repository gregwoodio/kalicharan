/*
 * At a school's bazaar, activities were divided into 'stalls'. At the 
 * close of the bazaar, the manager of each stall submitted information
 * to the Principal consisting of the name of the stall, the income earned
 * and its expenses. Some sample data were:
 *  Games 2300.00 1000.00
 *  Sweets 900.00 1000.00
 * Using a structure to hold a stall's data, write a program to read the
 * data and print a report consisting of stall name and net income
 * (income-expenses), in order of decreasing net income (that is, with the
 * most profitable stall last). In addition, print the number of stalls,
 * the total profit of loss of containing xxxxxx only ends the data.
