/*
 * A data file contains registration information for six courses - CS20A,
 * CS21A, CS29A, CS30A, CS35A and CS36A. Each line of data consists of a 
 * 7 digit student registration number followed by six (ordered) values,
 * each of which is a 0 or 1. A value of 1 indicates that the student is 
 * registered for the corresponding course; 0 means he is not. Thus 1 0 1
 * 0 1 1 means that the student is registered for CS20A, CS29A, CS35A and
 * CS36A, but not for CS21A and CS30A. You may assume that there are no
 * more than 100 students and a registration number 0 ends the data. Each
 * list begins on a new page and consists of the registration numbers for
 * those students taking the course.
